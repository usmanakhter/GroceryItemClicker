# GroceryItemClicker
**React native mobile app** to click specified grocery digital coupons for my mother. Because she finds the apps confusing to use on her phone, she uses another app (Flipp) to:
* first find the coupons she wants to click
* then open up her laptop at home and navigate to the digital coupon pages for Jewel/Mariano's
* then click each coupon individually

When she finds that the app failed to work or she clicked the wrong coupon, she's left with arguing with the employees and has no way to click coupons on the spot because her laptop is at home.

### This mobile app allows user to :
- type in desired coupons
- use UI to click open grocery digital coupon page for Jewel or Mariano's on mobile browser
- click on item after app searches for the specified item keyword
